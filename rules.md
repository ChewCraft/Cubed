# Official Cubed Survival Rules

## Chat Rules

1) No Hackusations. This means: Accusing a player of hacking (having an unfair advantage) is against the rules.<br/>
2) Bypassing our swear filter is an immediant mute. This is mostly based on assumptions, and if you think you were unfairly muted, report it on the [forums](http://mc.chew.pw/index.php?forums/ban-appeals.11/) and the admins will decide to modify the punishment at their discretion.<br/>
3) Death wishes are strictly forbidden. Saying terms such as, but not limited to, "kys", "go die", result in a mute.<br/>
4) Racism/Sexual misconduct is not allowed. Saying stuff like "omg i hate girls, too fat" will result in mute. This is mostly assumed but severe conduts are immediantly muted.<br/>
5) Bypassing your mute in any way (namely irc) will result in a tempban in place of the mute time. E.g. if you were muted for 10 minutes and you bypassed, your remaining time will be as a tempban.<br/>
6) Bullying is not allowed. Being mean to someone specifically in chat will result in a mute.<br/>
7) Do not spam the chat. Saying 3 messages in the span of 5 seconds counts as spam.<br/>
8) Disrespecting staff in any way, such as accusing of abuse, hacking, breaking rules, etc, will result in a mute at the staff's discretion.<br/>
9) NO ADVERTISING! If an IP is said in chat, the mute AND ban chart will be bypassed and a ban will be issued.<br/>
10) Impersonating Staff/YouTubers in any way will result in a ban chart ban.<br/>
11) Selling items outside of the server (like alts, etc) will bypass the ban chart and result in a ban!<br/>
12) Discussing other servers follows the mute chart.<br/>

## Playing Rules
All rules except rule 1 go immediantly to the ban chart.

1) No Hacking, this includes: Flying, speed mining, x-ray, kill aura, force field, or regen. Anything not stated on this list is not explicitly not allowed but can still be punished if it gives the player an unfair advantage. This rule bypasses the Ban Chart and is a perm ban.<br/>
2) Griefing IS allowed, bases may be destroyed in any way.<br/>
3) Raiding is only allowed if the player's container is not protected by a plugin. If a block is protected with a "magical spell", it may not be broken under any circumstances unless the player who owns the block breaks it.<br/>
4) Surface bases bigger than 10x10 (or at least 100 blocks) cannot be impenetrable (meaning a player attempting to get in can't get in) this includes via LWC or the Factions plugin, containers inside stated base may be protected as normal.<br/>
5) A small base can NOT be surrounded by a bigger base. If Player A cannot access their base without greifing Player B's base, it is bannable.<br/>
6) If a player enters combat (a player attacks another player, or vice versa) neither of the players may log out for 10 seconds after the last attack, nor may they enter a Non-PvP zone, this includes: Entering a TARDIS, teleporting away (altough ender pearls are allowed). This ban wears off until combat is not enabled (10 seconds after the last attack)<br/>
7) If the Player is AFK, they must not bypass the 5 minute AFK timer in any way.<br/>
8) Using an alt is against the rules. If found, the alt will be punished with a permanent ban and the owner will be punished with a 7-day + any previous alting bans day ban. This bypasses the Ban Chart.
