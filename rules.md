# Official Rules

1) No Hacking, this includes: Flying, speed mining, x-ray, kill aura, force field, or regen. Anything not stated on this list is not explicitly not allowed but can still be punished if it gives the player an unfair advantage.
2) Do not spawn kill. Remaining within 5 blocks of the spawn area with the sole purpose being to kill anyone who walks off is bannable.
3) griefing IS allowed, bases may be destroyed in any way.
4) raiding is only allowed if the players chest is not protected by a plugin. If a block is protected with a "magical spell", it must not be broken under any circumstances unless the player who owns the block breaks it.
5) Surface bases bigger than 10x10 (or at least 100 blocks) cannot be protected in signs (meaning a player attempting to get in can't get in), containers inside stated base may be protected as normal.
