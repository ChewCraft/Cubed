# Official Rules

1) No Hacking, this includes: Flying, speed mining, x-ray, kill aura, force field, or regen. Anything not stated on this list is not explicitly not allowed but can still be punished if it gives the player an unfair advantage.<br/>
2) Do not spawn kill. Remaining within 5 blocks of the drop bedrock area with the sole purpose being to kill anyone who walks away is bannable.<br/>
3) Griefing IS allowed, bases may be destroyed in any way.<br/>
4) Raiding is only allowed if the player's container is not protected by a plugin. If a block is protected with a "magical spell", it may not be broken under any circumstances unless the player who owns the block breaks it.<br/>
5) Surface bases bigger than 10x10 (or at least 100 blocks) cannot be impenetrable (meaning a player attempting to get in can't get in) this includes via LWC or the Factions plugin, containers inside stated base may be protected as normal.<br/>
6) A small base can NOT be surrounded by a bigger base. If Player A cannot access their base without greifing Player B's base, it is bannable.<br/>
7) If a player enters combat (a player attacks another player, or vice versa) neither of the players may log out for 10 seconds after the last attack, nor may they enter a Non-PvP zone, this includes: Entering a TARDIS, teleporting away (altough ender pearls are allowed). This ban wears off until combat is not enabled (10 seconds after the last attack)<br/>
8) If the Player is AFK, they must not bypass the 5 minute AFK timer in any way.
